# Configurable Steps Volume

Do you think your PMC walks like a toddler with a tantrum?
Tired of your steps sounding like explosions?
Did you watched the battlestate video about the making of the sound effects and realized they were actually stomping on concrete to get the sounds? (I can't find it anymore, did it got deleted?)

This mod fixes that by lowering the volume of your own footsteps.

This edits a hidden skill (BotSound) every time you create a new profile (or wipe an existing one) that makes your footsteps sound quieter.
At 0% reduction it doesn't do anything and you will enjoy the unmodified thundersteps you are already used to.
At 100% reduction your steps are completly silent.
This mod set it to 45% which seems around the normal volume steps have in other games.

This does not affect the sound the actual bots make or as far as I can tell their ability to hear you.
Only affects how much you hear your own footsteps.

Compatibility:
It could be incompatible with mods that change the generation of player scavs.

Installation: Place extracted folder SPT-ConfigurableStepsVolume inside user/mods

Known bugs:
The sound doesn't get updated for the first player scav. Play with him and the second one will work properly.
