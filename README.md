# Configurable Steps Volume

Do you think your PMC walks like a toddler with a tantrum?
Tired of your steps sounding like explosions?
Did you watched the battlestate video about the making of the sound effects and realized they were actually stomping on concrete to get the sounds? (I can't find it anymore, did it got deleted?)

This mod fixes that by lowering the volume of your own footsteps.

This edits a hidden skill (BotSound) every time you create a new profile (or wipe an existing one) that makes your footsteps sound quieter.
At 0% reduction it doesn't do anything and you will enjoy the unmodified thundersteps you are already used to.
At 100% reduction your steps are completly silent.
This mod set it to 45% which seems around the normal volume steps have in other games.

At least for now this only works for newly created profiles.
Pretty useful when multiple people create profiles in a social gathering server if you know what I mean.

If you wanna change an existing profile you will need to use a profile editor and change the BotSound skill.
